# RoboCup-Soccer 🤖⚽

Welcome to the **RoboCup Soccer Summer Camp HK 2025** repository.  
This is where we dump all the code, notes, and mildly exciting progress from our summer robotics adventure.

## 🛠 What’s This?

A summer camp project for building soccer-playing robots.  
We’re not making the World Cup here, but it rolls, kicks, and mostly doesn’t crash (yet).

Official RoboCup website:  
👉 [robocup.org](https://www.robocup.org)

## 🗂 Folder Boredom

- `src/` – Code that may or may not compile
- `docs/` – Rule PDFs, wiring diagrams, and stuff we’ll probably ignore
- `logs/` – Progress reports if someone remembers to write them
- `README.md` – You’re reading it. Congrats.

## 🌐 Slightly More Boring Stuff

- [alberttalkstech.com](https://www.alberttalkstech.com) – A site with things.
- [alberttalkstech.com/git](https://git.alberttalkstech.com) – Where all the repositories live. Not this one.

## 🙋 Who's Involved?

Campers, mentors, and maybe a rogue Roomba or two.

Let the barely-controlled chaos begin ⚙️🧠⚽
